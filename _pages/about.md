My research interests include machine learning, responsible and trustworthy AI, computer vision, AI in healthcare, and Natural language Processing. Recently, I served as a Judge in the [Deep Learning Indaba](https://deeplearningindaba.com/2025/) community challenge at Kigali, Rwanda, where i supported in evaluating innovative solutions from sevral teams from different countries.

I graduated from [Federal University Lokoja](https://www.fulokoja.edu.ng/) with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I was advised by Mrs. [Fati Oiza Ochepa](https://fulokoja.edu.ng/staff.php?i=870&sn=fati-ochepa). At Fulokoja, I worked in applied machine learning and decision-making, exploring applications in healthcare and social impact. For more details, please refer to the [`projects`](https://ahmadkhalidh.github.io/ahmadkhalid/projects/) section.

In my free time, I enjoy playing a variety of sports and capturing moments through photography.
