  abstract={Water quality monitoring is essential for protecting public health, sustaining ecosystems, and achieving Sustainable Development Goal 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation). While recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Machine Learning (ML), have improved the accuracy and responsiveness of water quality assessment, the opaque “black-box” nature of many AI models limits transparency, stakeholder trust, and regulatory compliance. Explainable AI (XAI) offers a viable solution by enabling human-understandable insights into model behaviour. This paper presents a PRISMA-guided systematic review of 60 peer-reviewed articles (2011–2025), sourced from Scopus, to evaluate the evolution, application, and effectiveness of XAI in water quality monitoring. Key techniques such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), and counterfactual reasoning have been applied across Random Forest, XGBoost, and LSTM models. Results indicate a surge in XAI adoption post-2022, with dominant use cases in groundwater prediction, surface water quality forecasting, and real-time monitoring in IoT-enabled smart cities. While SHAP remains the most widely used method, multimodal and hybrid frameworks are emerging to address challenges such as data heterogeneity and model complexity. The review identifies persistent barriers including computational scalability, lack of standardized evaluation metrics, and limited deployment in low-resource settings. It proposes future research directions for integrating XAI with digital twins, causal inference, and edge computing to achieve robust, transparent, and equitable water management systems.},

  title={A Real-Time Road Anomaly Detection via Masked Autoencoder-Enhanced Vision Transformers},
  author={Khalid, Hussain Ahmad and Fati, Oiza Ochepa.},
  abstract={This study presents a deep learning solution for detecting road anomalies via a hybrid architecture consisting of a Masked Autoencoder (MAE) and a Vision Transformer (ViT) model. It presented a framework for dual road classification, namely an intact road (good) and defected road (bad) where defected roads are characterized by anomalies such as potholes or cracks. The target road anomaly classification model was trained and tested using publicly available datasets of road condition images. The model demonstrated good feature extraction as well as good generalization with a training accuracy of 99.79% and a test accuracy of 98.29%. Furthermore, we integrated the road anomaly detection model into a web-application providing real-time road anomaly detection, exemplifying the possible benefits of applying computer vision and machine learning algorithms to improve road maintenance in Nigeria.},

  title={Advancing environmental sustainability through emerging AI-based monitoring and mitigation strategies for microplastic pollution in aquatic ecosystems},

  abstract={Microplastics have become a significant pollutant in aquatic ecosystems, with serious implications for biodiversity, food safety, and environmental sustainability. This paper reviews the nature and sources of microplastic pollution, alongside its ecological and human health impacts. Recognizing the limitations of traditional monitoring and removal methods, the study explores emerging artificial intelligence (AI)-based strategies as innovative tools for improving environmental monitoring and pollution mitigation. The manuscript discusses how AI techniques such as machine learning, computer vision, and remote sensing can enhance the detection, classification, and prediction of microplastic distribution in water bodies. It also highlights the potential of AI-driven robotic systems in supporting targeted mitigation efforts. While these technologies show promise, further interdisciplinary research and development are necessary to fully realize their application in real-world environmental management. The integration of AI offers a proactive path toward achieving cleaner aquatic ecosystems and supporting global sustainability goals.},
