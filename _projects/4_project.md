I am currently conducting a literature review focused on the development of an AI-based system for the early detection of plant diseases using Vision Transformers and multispectral imagery. This work involves examining recent advances in deep learning and computer vision methods applied to agriculture, with particular attention to how transformer-based architectures improve feature extraction and classification performance in complex imaging data. In collaboration with my research supervisor, I am exploring how multispectral inputs can enhance model accuracy by capturing disease symptoms beyond the visible spectrum, while also assessing current challenges such as data scarcity, class imbalance, and generalization across crop types and environmental conditions. The goal of this review is to establish a solid foundation for designing a robust framework that leverages state-of-the-art methods for timely and reliable plant disease detection.
