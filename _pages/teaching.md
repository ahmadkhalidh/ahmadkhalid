**Federal University Lokoja**

- **PHY-111 General Mechanics**
- **PHY-131 Heat and Properties of Matter**
- **PHY-211 Mechanics w/Calc**
- **MTH-111 Elementary Mathematics**
- **Math/CS General Tutor:** Counseled students with coding (Python, C++), Core CS topics, and computational topics like Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Discrete Structures.

I really enjoy tutoring and want to keep doing it as I continue my studies. As a first-generation college student, I'm especially passionate about helping students from minority backgrounds. If you think I could help in any way, feel free to reach out!
