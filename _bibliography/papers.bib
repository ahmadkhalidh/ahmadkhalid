  title={A Real-Time Road Anomaly Detection via Masked Autoencoder-Enhanced Vision Transformers},
  author={Khalid*†, A.H. and Fati*, o.o.},
  abstract={This study presents a deep learning solution for detecting road anomalies via a hybrid architecture consisting of a Masked Autoencoder (MAE) and a Vision Transformer (ViT) model. It presented a framework for dual road classification, namely an intact road (good) and defected road (bad) where defected roads are characterized by anomalies such as potholes or cracks. The target road anomaly classification model was trained and tested using publicly available datasets of road condition images. The model demonstrated good feature extraction as well as good generalization with a training accuracy of 99.79% and a test accuracy of 98.29%. Furthermore, we integrated the road anomaly detection model into a web-application providing real-time road anomaly detection, exemplifying the possible benefits of applying computer vision and machine learning algorithms to improve road maintenance in Nigeria.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
