My research interests include machine learning, responsible and trustworthy AI, computer vision, AI in healthcare, and Natural language Processing. Recently, I served as a Judge in the [Deep Learning Indaba](https://deeplearningindaba.com/2025/) community challenge held in Kigali, Rwanda, where i supported the evaluation of innovative solutions from several teams across different countries in Africa.

I graduated with First Class Honours in Computer Science from [Federal University Lokoja](https://www.fulokoja.edu.ng/), earning a Bachelor of Science degree. I was advised by Mrs. [Fati Oiza Ochepa](https://fulokoja.edu.ng/staff.php?i=870&sn=fati-ochepa). My undergraduate research, titled "Real-Time Road Anomaly Detection via Masked Autoencoder-Enhanced Vision Transformers," explored how self-supervised learning and transformer-based architectures can improve the accuracy and efficiency of computer vision systems in real-world road conditions. For more details, please refer to the [`projects`](https://ahmadkhalidh.github.io/ahmadkhalid/projects/) section.

Outside of academics, I enjoy staying active through sports and games, as well as engaging with peers and exploring emerging trends in AI and technology
